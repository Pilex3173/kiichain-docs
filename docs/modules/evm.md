# EVM Module

The **EVM module** brings full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility to KiiChain, enabling the execution of Solidity-based smart contracts directly on the network.

## Overview
By integrating EVM functionality, KiiChain allows developers to deploy, call, and interact with Ethereum-style contracts while benefiting from Cosmos SDKâ€™s modular and efficient architecture.

## Key Features
- Supports Solidity smart contracts.
- Compatible with Ethereum development tools (Remix, MetaMask, Hardhat).
- Enables interoperability between EVM and native Cosmos modules.
- Provides a gas model aligned with the Cosmos SDK fee system.

## Main Functions
- Developers interact with the EVM module using Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints and Cosmos SDK messages such as `MsgEthereumTx`. Contract deployment and calls follow standard Ethereum procedures.
